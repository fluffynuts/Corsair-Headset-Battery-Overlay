# Corsair-Void-Pro-Battery-Overlay
A transparent WPF overlay that displays the battery charge level of the Corsair Void Pro headset. Once started it starts automatically on every system startup. The overlay is always on top of all applications so you dont have to f.e. tab out of a game to check your battery status.

## Usage
* `STRG + B` to toggle visibility of the overlay
* `ALT + X` to Exit application
* Doubleclick overlay to resize
* Click and move overlay to reposition
